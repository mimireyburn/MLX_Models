# Some Learnings from MLX Institute, Founders and Coders
My handwritten models and experiments from the intensive ML program at FAC.

## Transformers
*Transformer Architecture: Week 4 Project at MLX Institute, Founders and Coders*

A GPT for generating new stories. A Transformer architecture containing Multi-Headed Self-Attention and tracking with Weights and Biases, trained on the TinyStories dataset. 

## PCA
*CNNs and Autoencoders: Week 2 Project at MLX Institute, Founders and Coders*

A CNN autoencoder script for visualising similarity between a dataset of images from the MLX Institue TinyWorld simulation, including interactive 3D plots of Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to visualise clusters of similar encodings. 


*Both files can be run as Jupyter Notebooks in VSC with the Jupyter Extension.*
